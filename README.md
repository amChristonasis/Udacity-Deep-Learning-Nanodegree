# Udacity-Deep-Learning-Nanodegree
In this repository, I will be pushing the projects I build while doing the Deep Learning Nanodegree from Udacity. I am enrolled in the Nanodegree after passing through phase 1 of a scholarship challenge course given by Udacity and Bertlesmann. This is also a phase 2 scholarship offered by them for selected performers of the first round of the scholarship.
