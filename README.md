# Udacity-Deep-Learning-Nanodegree
In this repository, I will be pushing the projects I build while doing the Deep Learning Nanodegree from Udacity. I am enrolled in the Nanodegree after passing through phase 1 of a scholarship challenge course given by Udacity and Bertlesmann. This is also a phase 2 scholarship offered by them for selected performers of the first round of the scholarship.

## Project 1: Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns
In the first Nanodegree project I had to predict the number of bikes that would be needed from a bike-sharing company based on historical data and relevant features such as the humidity, wind, and day of the week. I implemented the forward, back-propagation, and update of weights in Numpy for the training of a fully-connected neural network. I also picked the hyperparameters that increased the accuracy the most. I achieved a validation loss of 0.168 based on the mean squared error of the last 60 days of the dataset.
